##Summary
Being able to effectively communicate during an emergency will dynamically improve your ability to make those aware of your situation and condition, and  provide you with details as they develop to prepare and plan better.

Two is one and one is none, ensure that you have redundant methods to receive the alerts and that all parties included in your action plan also receive alerts for areas where you will be traveling. Using a service like [Nixle](http://www.nixle.com/), can provide you with push notifications and emails from local emergency services.

Having access and knowing how to use an amateur radio can afford you the ability to tune to local non-digital emergency services. However most groups now coordinate with digital encrypted radio channels. Being equipped and prepared to use another form of technology to communicate can be a game changer, be sure to test and stay proficient with your equipment.   

__Communicate to loved ones__
Communicating with loved ones is key: one goal of disaster planning is to know that your family is safe. It is paramount to communicate your status to family members throughout an entire emergency. Prior making the call, prepare yourself by writing down what you need you communicate. Speaking to loved one after an event may cause emotions and stress being prepared prior allows you to share critical details that help you and your loved know how to support you.

## Communication
**Summary** - Communication is essential during an emergency, there is nothing better than knowing that your loved ones are okay. This section is focused on the method of communication, what to communicate is in the section above. Building a communication plan is almost as important as practicing it.
The methods of communication are categorized under SMS/Text, Cell Phone/ Land Line, HAM Radio. Contacts are broken into three categories Local, Regional, and Long Distance.
Local within walking distance, meaning you could walk to the location within reason. For example we could walk to Susan from our home, Susan would be considered a local contact.
Regional outside of walking distance but within a car ride to the location. Berkeley, and El Dorado would be considered examples of regional.
Long Distance any location outside of the regional, Ideally these are locations that wouldn’t be directly impacted by the event.
Methods of communication should be from simplest to complex, depending on the event. The goal of the communication is leave enough information so that resources and decisions can be made in your absence. Follow the order in each method below until you have made a successful contact.


**SMS/ Text -** SMS uses the least amount of bandwidth, and doesn’t require a full signal to make a successful transmission

**Cell Phones -** Wireless carries are limited by number of towers times the number of active connections.  In a regional emergency cell phones may not be effective, but worth trying.

**Analog Land Lines -** Traditional land lines, or analog phones have been phased out for digital cordless devices. During an emergency office PBX systems can be stressed and require a power source. The fancy digital phone you have home may also require power (headset and base). Locating a true analog phone during an emergency can be challenging, it’s recommend having one at home.

**Amateur Radio -** Requires a FCC license and training. Handheld and mobile stations can utilize regional repeaters with emergency power. Some repeaters have an “auto patch” mode that allows an analog call to be placed. You also have the ability to use the ARES network were trained emergency radio operator’s can relay a message to local, regional, and long distance contacts.
