# Family Disaster & Emergency Action Plan (EAP)

##Objective
**Important information, reference materials, and templates to used for emergencies and disasters planning**

 The goal of this Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is to prepare you to respond to an emergency in a coordinated effort with  preplanned actions, reducing the need to think in an emergency and reducing actions that can increase risk.  The main topics are outlined in order:

1. Defend against the immediate threat and get out of immediate danger (Duck, Cover, and Hold)
2. Gain situational awareness to size up the scene
3. Address life threats
3. Stay Alive (shelter in place or evacuate)

Each section contains an __Objective__ and __Plan__. The objective covers the "why" and continues to help you probe and make mitigation plans to your environment. The plan provides a template (to be freely modified and adjusted to match your particular environment) to start your personal EAP.


**How & Why**  
In 2012, a friend introduced me to the idea of planning and preparing for an emergency. My family I lived in the Bay Area and knew we should do something, but didn't have a clue where to start. This friend kindly share a Pages document with me and I freely edited it and built on it. I took wilderness first aid classes, obtained my FCC license to use an amateur radio, I also took a few urban survival classes though by former Special Forces.

As I learned, I updated my guide to reflect those new things. When I would met up with my friend we disclose all the new work we had done independently to our EAP's. Every time I shared my copy with someone new, they would get a newer version. In 2015, I decided to move to version control method but never found the time. In 2020, I discovered MKDOCs while working on a documentation project and instantly knew that this was the tool to share.
