##STOP
For all emergencies, getting out of immediate danger requires assessing the situation to determine if there are any immediate threats to yourself, others around you, or pets, and if so, taking steps to mitigate these threats. The first thing we forget to use is our senses, **STOP** Listen, Look, Touch, and Smell. Slowing down and assessing the situation allows you to make the best decision the next steps to protect yourself and those around you.  

Here are simple questions to ask when determining if there is an immediate threat:

- Touch & Look; Is anyone bleeding? Feel for wounds, look for blood on your fingers
- Touch; Is the building/car/train shaking?
- Look; Is anything obstructing movement or an exit?
- Listen; do you hear anyone screaming?
- Listen; do you hear sirens or a loudspeaker?
- Smell; Do you smell gas, smoke?

For an Earthquake, getting out of immediate danger means **Duck, Cover, and Hold.**

**Duck:** Drop to the floor. Getting down on the floor is safer because it prevents you from falling when trying to move.

**Cover:** Crawl under a sturdy desk or piece of furniture like a table. If there is nowhere to crawl under, put your back up against an interior wall, pull your knees into your chest and cover your head with your arms.

**Hold:** Hold onto the furniture until the shaking stops. If you are not under a piece of furniture, just hold your protecting position. An earthquake can last for a minute or more.

##Determine the nature of the emergency
The primary goal of determining the nature of the emergency is to decide if you should to **shelter in place or evacuate** to a safer location or meet-up location.  Secondary goals are to gather information in order to determine if there are simple steps that you can take to stop or minimize the emergency.  Determining if you are to shelter in place or evacuate can be deduced by the type of emergency: is it a natural disaster, like an earthquake or fire, or a man-made emergency, like a terrorist attack or auto accident.  Other ways to deduce this is by the news, or by listening to a radio or an Emergency Broadcast System (like a loudspeaker).  Use common sense to determine if you are going to leave and know your exit routes and your limits:  **Donâ€™t become a victim.**
