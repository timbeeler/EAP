# Evacuation
---

##Summary
 Remember, the goal is to evacuate to safety or find the safest shelter-in-place location. It is extremely important to pause for a moment to decide if it is safer to be outside or inside during an event.  Listen to your instincts. For example, during an earthquake, it may be safer to be outside to avoid a building structural collapse, but during a biohazard incident, it may be safer to be inside, with the doors locked and all windows closed and sealed.

## Evacuation or Shelter-in-place?
If you are home when an emergency occurs, it is important to quickly decide if you can get out the front door, or if you need to shelter-in-place for a period of time. Take in to account the time needed to get the animals.  You **DO NOT** need to get the emergency supplies; the survival gear is useless if you are injured or killed trying to retrieve it before evacuating.

## Pets
Don't try to hold your pet during a quake. Animals instinctively want to hide when their safety is threatened. If you get in their way, even the nicest pets may hurt you. Watch animals closely. Leash dogs and place them in a fenced yard. Pets may not be allowed into shelters for health and space reasons. Prepare an emergency pen for pets in the home that includes a 3-day supply of dry food and a large container of water. If you can't find your pet or must leave it at home after a quake, leave fresh water in non-spill containers such as bathtubs and sinks. Leave plenty of low-fat dry food, which deteriorates more slowly and is less tasty so pets won't try to eat it all at once. Leave a note indicating that you have a pet, where you will be and the date.

## Evacuation - Home
If you evacuate the home, move to a place that is at minimal risk for falling buildings, trees, and power lines. Having two evacuation points predetermined allows you move and regroup before assessing and developing your plan. A quick location should be at least 20 feet from your front door a more stable location should be reachable by foot, provide shelter, and immediate safety. Locations like a park, school yard, or firehouse may be good candidates. The more details you know about your evacuation points the better, understanding that businesses that store chemicals (dry cleaners) near or along the path to your stable location may provide a risk during a large category event.
